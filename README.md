# Unnamed Typing Challenge

I currently don't know what to call this. I built this based off a blank tailwind react blank project.
If you get offended easily, I would avoid this project. I built this after I got cussed out on a video game by someone who was easily typing 140 wpm. 
His perfect spelling and passion outweighed my disgust with what he was typing. I knew I had to make something.
